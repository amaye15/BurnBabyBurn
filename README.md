# BurnBabyBurn: Deep Learning in Rust with Burn

## Introduction

Welcome to "BurnBabyBurn," an exploratory deep learning project leveraging the power and efficiency of Rust and the Burn framework. This project marks our first venture into the realm of deep learning within the Rust ecosystem. Our goal is to combine Rust's performance and safety with the dynamic capabilities of Burn to create a model that is both efficient and robust.

## Project Objectives

- **Explore Deep Learning with Rust**: To understand and utilize Rust's capabilities in the context of deep learning.
- **Leverage Burn Framework**: To make full use of Burn's flexibility, efficiency, and ease of use for deep learning applications.
- **Develop a Deep Learning Model**: To create and train a deep learning model that demonstrates the capabilities of Burn and Rust.
- **Benchmark Performance**: To evaluate and compare the performance of our Rust-based model against traditional Python-based models.
- **Contribute to Rust's AI Ecosystem**: To provide insights, feedback, and potentially contribute to the development of the Burn framework.

## Technology Stack

- **Programming Language**: Rust
- **Deep Learning Framework**: Burn
- **Version Control**: Git and GitHub
- **Additional Tools**: Docker (for environment management), Continuous Integration Tools

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, you'll need to have Rust installed on your system. Follow these steps:

1. **Install Rust**: Follow the instructions on the [official Rust website](https://www.rust-lang.org/learn/get-started) to install Rust.
2. **Clone This Repository**: Use `git clone` to clone this repository to your local machine.
3. **Add Burn Dependency**: In your `Cargo.toml`, add Burn as a dependency.
4. **Explore the Code**: Familiarize yourself with the existing codebase and documentation.

## Contribution Guidelines

We welcome contributions from anyone interested in Rust and deep learning! Whether you are a seasoned Rustacean or new to the language, your insights and contributions are valuable. Please read our [Contribution Guidelines](CONTRIBUTION.md) for more information on how to participate.

## Learning Resources

For those new to Rust or Burn, we have compiled a list of resources to get you up to speed:

- [The Rust Programming Language Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/)
- [Burn Framework Documentation](https://burn.rs/docs)
- [Deep Learning Basics](https://www.deeplearningbook.org/)

## Project Status

This project is currently in its initial stages. We are working on setting up the basic architecture and defining our first deep learning model.
